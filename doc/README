== Introduction ==

A sample application built using vlcj and libvlc that streams internet radio.

This application reads various internet radio station directories and allows 
you to search that combined directory to play radio station audio streams of 
interest.


== License ==

vlcj is distributed under the terms of the GPL-3 license.

vlc is distributed under the terms of the GPL license.

JNA is distributed under the terms of the LGPL license.

GlazedLists is distributed under the terms of the LGPL license.

MIGLayout is distributed under the terms of the GPL license.

The Simple XML framework is distributed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.

HtmlUnit is distributed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.


== Recording Streams ==

This example application also includes a feature to demonstrate how to use 
libvlc to record an audio stream.

Some internet streaming sites forbid in their terms and conditions the saving of 
streams. It is your responsibility to make sure you have permission to save all
such streams.

Further, in some territories it may not be permitted to encode the audio as MP3
without paying a fee to obtain a license. Again, it is your responsibility to
make sure you have permission to encode the audio as MP3 and to abide by
whatever the relevant laws are in your jurisdiction.

This software contains no MP3 encoder of it's own, an MP3 encoder is only 
available if your OS distribution makes it available.

In all instances, a condition of use of this software is that you take full
responsibility for the streams you record.

Recorded streams will end up in a "vlcj-radio" directory inside your user home
directory.
